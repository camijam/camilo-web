    <h1 class="titulo">Has artificial intelligence arrived to change the rules of the labor market?
    </h1>
    <h3 class="intro">Artificial intelligence has reached the labor market and has transformed the way we work and interact. However, we are living only the beginning of a great digital revolution that will change the economy and society towards a new business model, which seeks the automation of basic processes and better performance. In this article, we will discuss the main limits and challenges we will face as a society in the coming years.
    </h3>
    <p class="text">Perhaps we are facing the greatest technological, social and economic challenge of all time. Society is advancing at an accelerated pace, new technologies, market globalization, digital transformations, and now... Artificial intelligence is coming to change the rules. It seems that we are approaching the reality of a futuristic movie, however, these new technologies are already present in our daily lives and, of course, in the labor market.</p></br>
    <p class="text">The development in topics related to mathematical algorithms, big data and process automation has triggered the need to use artificial intelligence in the working world. However, opinions on this topic and its impact on our society are divided. On the one hand, the economy could benefit by optimizing processes and improving labor yields, but on a societal level, some jobs could disappear (Benhamou, 2020). For example, transportation companies can employ artificial intelligence to eliminate drivers, which would generate a cost reduction but consequently a job elimination. </p></br>
    <p class="text">According to Caseau (2020), changes will be most representative in three areas of our society. Production, transaction, and interaction. The first two will be most affected by automation and intelligent robots, as they will replace human labor. But interactions, being linked to the social area, will remain under the control and domain of humans, with a strong focus on experience and the exchange of emotions. In fact, there are studies that seek to create emotional ties between machines and humans, with the aim of increasing this relationship (Berlinski, 2020) and thus, artificial intelligence can become part of all three domains. </p></br>
    <p class="text">Although there are different points of view, artificial intelligence can also be seen as a transformation and evolution of the jobs of the future. Some say that by automating processes, we will be able to concentrate our work on developing complex cognitive processes and enhance our cognitive skills, leaving aside repetitive processes that can be replaced by a robot. However, from a negative point of view, it may be the beginning of new social inequalities, where society is divided between those who are part of the digital transformation and those who are not. In fact, 44% of workers say they are not ready to work with artificial intelligence (Brut, 2018). </p></br>
    <p class="text">In conclusion, the societal shift towards an automated society has already begun. We don't have to go far to realize that we are ruled by smartphones and slaves of computers with internet connectivity. It is simply difficult to think of life without technology, but how far can we go? Now, digital transformation must be accompanied by training, learning, and management. The discussion is broad, and we can analyze it from different points of view. In the labor market, IT skills are basic for the development of any job. Then, we could ask ourselves: if there is a relation between the formative work of universities and the existing labor market demands? </p></br>
